% Q3)
function test_myran()

% generate 1,000 random numbers from your ¡°myran.m¡± and store them in the memory
N = 1000;
result = myran(N);

% Then, you calculate and draw probability density function of your random number sequence. 


% The size of the bin is set to be 0.1. 
% Does it look uniform distribution to you?
% Does it match with the expected value of the probability density function? 
% If it doesn¡¯t, why?
